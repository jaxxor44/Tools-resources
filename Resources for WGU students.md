>[!quote]- dougthonus | dthonu1
>Here's a box, figure out what to do. It requires you to know all the different skills already and gives you things to practice on. I have a lot of computer expertise but not a lot of offensive security expertise (mostly what I got in the BS CIA program which I completed in June). I found the HTB stuff to largely be beyond my reach without just looking at and following through guides on the internet. In some respects, that isn't so different than HTB Academy which effectively is similar with just the guide built in, but it all felt like cheating, and there wasn't a similar follow up challenge without the guide to try once you got the 1st one with the guide. Probably best served for people with a lot of offensive security expertise already, even the "easy" boxes aren't that beginner friendly
- **Hack the Box Academy**
	- $8USD/Month [Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/)
>[!quote]- dougthonus | dthonu1
>Training's feel much better put together than THM in the sense of you aren't wasting time filling in lots of meaningless answers.   Gives good direction to do things.   The modules I've done are built by having you solve some stuff with pretty clear instructions then giving you a problem that is effectively the same with enough differences that you can't cut and paste it but similar enough you can achieve success.  Best if you have some decent computer skills / linux skills already, so probably a bit less accessible for a total computer beginner, but still aimed at offensive security beginners
- **Try Hack Me**
	- 20% off, about $10USD/month. [Student discount](https://help.tryhackme.com/billing/student-discount)
>[!quote]- dougthonus | dthonu1
> Lowest barrier of entry, has explanations for everything, a lot of stuff is stupidly easy, so it isn't intimidating.  Can get aggravating at times because it feels like you are just trying to look up key words in text to answer questions.  Best choice if you are starting from zero and have relatively little IT experience.  Has some training for general IT stuff as well mixed in
